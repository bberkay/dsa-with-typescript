    Linear Search

    Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.

    Time Complexity
        1. Best Case: O(1)
        2. Average Case: O(n)
        3. Worst Case: O(n)

    Space Complexity: O(1)
