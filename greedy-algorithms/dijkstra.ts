    Dijkstra Algorithm

    Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.

    In Real Life:
        1. Google Maps: Finding the shortest path from your location to your destination.
        2. Network Routing: Finding open shortest path for data transfer.
        3. Biology: Used to model the spread of viruses among humans.
